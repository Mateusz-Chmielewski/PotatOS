# Simple real-time operating system for STM32F4 family microcontrollers.


## Building the code

Before you can build the firmware, make sure you have the required cross-compiler installed:

1. Install the ARM cross-compiler </br>
On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems: </br>
```sh
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

2. Create a build directory </br>
Navigate to the os project directory and create a build folder: </br>
```sh
cd os
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Generate build files using CMake </br>
Inside the build directory, run: </br>
```sh
cmake ..
```

4. Compile the project </br>
Still inside the build directory, compile the code: </br>

```sh
make
```
After a successful build, this will produce a firmware.bin file â€” the final binary ready to run on the board or simulator. </br>

5. Run the firmware </br>
To launch the firmware in a simulator (like Renode), you can use a preconfigured Docker container. Instructions for that are provided in the next section. </br></br>
To launch the firmare on board see Flashing board section </br>

## Running on docker with [Renode](https://github.com/renode/renode) emulator. 

Note for Windows users: Run these commands from WSL </br>
1. Build the Docker image </br>
From the os directory, build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t stm ./
```

2. Create the Docker container
```
docker create --name stm-container \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v ./build:/app/build \
  -p 3333:3333 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/stm32f4.resc",target=/renode/stm32f4.resc \
  -ti stm
```

3. Start the container and launch Renode </br>
Run the container interactively:
```
docker start -ai stm-container
```

Restarting the container
For future runs, simply use:
```
docker start -ai stm-container
```

Updating the firmware
1. Rebuild the code with make (in the build directory).
2. In the Renode terminal, enter the following command:
```
machine Reset
```
This reloads the new firmware.bin without restarting the container.

## Operating Renode eumulator

commands in emulator:
- s, start - starts emulator
- p, pause - stops emulator
- machine Reset - loads new buit firmware
- q, quit - quits emulator
- showAnalyzer usart1 - shows uart1 terminal monitor 

## Flashing the STM32 Board

To flash the STM32 microcontroller, we use the stlink utility.

1. Install stlink tools
On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, WSL, etc.):

```
sudo apt install stlink-tools
```
This provides the st-flash utility to upload binaries to STM32 devices via ST-Link.

### Connecting STM32 USB to WSL
1. Install usbipd-win on Windows
In PowerShell (run as Administrator):
```
winget install usbipd
```

2.  List available USB devices
In PowerShell:
```
usbipd list
```
Look for the STM32 ST-Link device. Example output:
```
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
2-1    0483:374b  ST-Link Debug, USB Mass Storage Device                        Shared
```

4. Attach the device to WSL
Use the bus ID shown next to the ST-Link in the previous step:
```
usbipd attach --busid 2-1 --wsl
```
If there is `usbipd: error: Loading vhci_hcd failed.` run in wsl:
```
sudo modprobe vhci_hcd
```

5. Verify connection inside WSL
```
lsusb
```

You should see something like:

```
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0483:374b STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1
```

### Flashing the firmware
From the build directory, flash the board:

```
st-flash --reset write firmware.bin 0x8000000
```
This writes the binary to flash memory and resets the MCU.

Serial Monitor (optional)
To view UART output from the board</br>
```
cu -l /dev/ttyACM0 -s 9600
```
Replace /dev/ttyACM0 with the correct device if needed (dmesg | grep tty can help you find it).

## Debuging code
To debug your code using Visual Studio Code (with a launch.json configuration), you'll need to install the GDB multi-architecture debugger:
```
sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
```
